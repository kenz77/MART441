This weeks assignment was very difficult. I couldn't seem to get things to
work the way I wanted them to. Hopefully I will do better in the final
assignment. This whole class has pretty much been a struggle for me, but I still
have learned quite a bit. I still wish I understood it more becuase it's
really confusing to me.
