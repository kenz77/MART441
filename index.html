<h3>About Me</h3>
I am a Junior here at the University of Montana. I am majoring in
  Media Arts as well as Fine Arts. My focuses are graphic design, painting,
  and ceramics (but mainly Graphic Design). Graphic Design was my first choice for the
  career I want, but I also love fine arts. I thought I would at least minor in fine Arts
  so that I may take some studio classes, but I desided that double majoring would be even better.
   <br>I started an internship with Sarah Holden. She owns
  an oils and herbs company. I designed a logo for her and she loved it. She payed me $20 per hour.
  I will continue working with her once this spring semester is over. She also recomended me to
  a couple of her friends who need logos as well and I would like to try to get the word out to
  people at some point so I may continue to design logos for people and also business cards, ect.
  I am also skilled in photography and love taking pictures whether I'm getting payed for it or not.</br>
