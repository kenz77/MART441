<h2>About Me</h2><br></br>
<br>I am a Junior here at the University of Montana. I am majoring in
  Media Arts as well as Fine Arts. My focuses are graphic design, painting,
  and ceramics (but mainly Graphic Design). Graphic Design was my first choice for the
  career I want, but I also love fine arts. I thought I would at least minor in fine Arts
  so that I may take some studio classes, but I desided that double majoring would be even better.</br>
   <br>I started an internship with Sarah Holden. She owns
  an oils and herbs company. I designed a logo for her and she loved it. She payed me $20 per hour.
  I will continue working with her once this spring semester is over. She also recomended me to
  a couple of her friends who need logos as well and I would like to try to get the word out to
  people at some point so I may continue to design logos for people and also business cards, ect.
  I am also skilled in photography and love taking pictures whether I'm getting payed for it or not.</br>
  <br>
  What I do in my spare time depends on the wheather. During the winter I like to stay inside and watch movies
  or maybe go bowling because I'm not much for winter sports and I hate the cold. During the summer I like to be outside
  as much as possible. I love camping, fishing, boating, hiking/ walking the dog or just sit ouside and enjoy
  the sunshine. I play on a christian softball league in the spring which I really enjoy. I've been playing
  softball since I was about 5 years old.
