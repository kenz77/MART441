# HW-5 Readme for Mackenzie Lightfield

This weeks assignment went pretty well. There is so much information to learn about Javascript though. It is quite a bit to take in and be able to use that to write my own code. But I did my best and with a little help, I got it all done. I am still not a fan of Javascript though. It is not fun.
