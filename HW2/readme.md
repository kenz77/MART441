This week was not too bad now that I have reviewed some HTML from the last web design class that I took. Javascript
looks a little confusing so far, but we shall see how it goes once we start getting into some more complicated and likely confusing stuff in the rest of the semester. I still have some issues getting things to link right so I always have to go back several times to fix it so it works. This looks like it's going to be a difficult class for me.
